All basic requirements have been fully implemented.

Extra Credit:

If you press 'V' it will loop through all of the keyframes thus far and create a video out of them for you. Uses ffmpeg

If you press 'O' you'll enable SQUAD spline interpolation, where you'll see movements become a bit more nuanced

Scroll Bar is also fully implemented

A video called bonusanim.mp4 is included for the cool animation bonus points.

Pressing 'K' will up the sampling for Anti-aliasing to 64

Thanks
